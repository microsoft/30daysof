# Machine Learning

Machine learning is often the foundation for an AI system and is the way we "teach" a computer model to make predictions and draw conclusions from data. It automates the process of pattern-discovery by finding meaningful insights from real-world or generated data.

**Regression models:** If you want to predict the probable height for a person of a given age, you'd use linear regression, as you're seeking a numeric value.

**Classification models:** this is a form of supervised learning that bears a lot in common with regression techniques. If machine learning is all about predicting values or names to things by using datasets, then classification generally falls into two groups: binary classification and multiclass classification.

> In this week, we learn how we "teach" a computer model to make predictions and draw conclusions from data.

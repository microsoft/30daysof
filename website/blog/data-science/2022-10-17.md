## Welcome! 

![30 Days of Data Science Roadmap](./img/roadmap.png)
[30 Days of Data Science Welcome Message](https://aka.ms/http://aka.ms/30DaysDataScience)

Our goal is to guide you through understanding data and using the knowledge to make decisions such as fraud detection, customer segmentation and product pricing. At the end of this, you will have 3 guided projects and one capstone project to showcase in your porfolio.

## Day 1: Summary
As a code-first developer, where do you fit in the Low Code/No Code (LCNC) Environment (Power Platform)?

<!-- ![Fusion Team Development Process]() -->
### Fusion Teams - Roles & Responsibilities
Fusion Teams Empower everyone to do more. A code first developer builds an API, which can then be made into a connector and in turn, connectors can be made into drag and drop components to be used by citizen developers in low code solutions
  1. Citizen Developers
      * Understand the business
      * Solve their own challenges using Technology

  2. IT Professionals
      * Enable high productivity app development.
      * Implement governance and compliance.

  3. Professional Developers
        * Reduce time to develop and deploy.
        * Use code to unblock complex requirements.

### Participation Options
1. Identify an [existing connector on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPlatformConnectors/tree/dev/independent-publisher-connectors/?WT.mc_id=academic-73999-juliamuiruri) and improve it!
1. Use an already deployed API to build a connector! [Recommended]
1. Build an API from scratch, deploy it and build a connector using it!

* All independent publisher contributors are advised to go through the [Independent publisher certification process guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/certification-submission-ip?WT.mc_id=academic-73999-juliamuiruri) before building & submitting their connectors
* Participants who opt to improve existing connectors can ONLY improve connectors in the [Independent-Publisher-Connectors](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPlatformConnectors/tree/dev/independent-publisher-connectors/?WT.mc_id=academic-73999-juliamuiruri) folder in the repository

### Incentives & awards
- ** All participants ** who submit a working connector will receive the [M365 Platform Community - Independent  Publisher 2022 Badge](https://www.credly.com/org/m365pnp/badge/m365-platform-community-independent-publisher-2022) to add to their CV/portfolio

- ** 5 Cloud Skills Challenge Random Winners ** will be awarded with a special SWAG Pack

- ** The Top 4 Connectors ** will each receive the Hackathon Grand Prize

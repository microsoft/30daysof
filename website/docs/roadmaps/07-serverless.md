## Azure Container Apps

_Welcome to Week 2. You've learnt how to build event-driven serverless backends using Azure Functions. But how can you orchestrate and scale more complex solutions? The answer lies in microservice architectures and containerized apps. This week we explore Azure Container Apps (ACA) - and learn how the Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr) technology can work alongside ACA to unlock richer capabilities and simplify developer experience._

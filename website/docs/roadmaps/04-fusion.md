## Kickoff 
Organizations today are embracing ‘fusion development’ to drive digital transformation in their businesses. A fusion development team brings together Pro Devs, IT admins, citizen Devs, researchers, and business managers to collaborate in building transformative technological solutions. 

This #30DaysOfFusion - Microsoft Connector Hackathon Pilot Program, welcomes you to contribute in building power platform connectors that will make it possible for low code developers to connect to as many external data sources as they would need.

 Note: Check out the [Microsoft 356 Platform Community](https://pnp.github.io/?WT.mc_id=academic-73999-juliamuiruri) to learn how to build apps on Microsoft 365

And Kudos! to everyone who was able to learn new skills and apply them throughout the program.

Good News!! Your journey doesn't have to end here. We published an article that will guide anyone on [how to build an Independent Publisher connector as a school Capstone project](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/educator-developer-blog/capstone-project-build-an-independent-publisher-connector/ba-p/3655738). We still need your help to build to build connectors on this [Top Connector Asks](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPlatformConnectors/wiki/Top-Connector-Asks) List and the resource above provides you with all you will need for each step (blogs, video recordings & documentation).

Additionally, we have a [Student Independent Publisher Community](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/9248828/) on LinkedIn and we welcome you to join us and learn more about how you can use your coding skills to create projects that will help thousands of Power Platform Users.

Technology changes fast! The only way to adapt, and thrive, is to learn continuously - and apply learnings to practical problems.\\n\\nSo, what does that learning journey look like? Think of it as four stages:\\n * **Welcome** - the onboarding phase, to set you up for success! \\n * **Guide** - the exploration phase, where you pick the learning path to follow.\\n * **Connect** - the community phase, where you meet & help others on that path.\\n * **Share** - the pay-it-forward phase, where you share insights for future travelers.\\n\\n![Placeholder banner with red flowers](./../../static/img/banners/learning.png)\\n\\n## About The Site\\n\\nLet\'s take a quick tour of this site and the various features it offers:\\n\\n * \ud83c\udfe0 [**Landing Page**](/) - explore the learning options available.\\n * \u270d\ud83c\udffc [**Blog**](/blog) - subscribe to the [feed](/blog/rss.xml) for announcements & updates\\n * \ud83d\uddd3 [**Calendar**](/calendar) - discover upcoming events, revisit archived ones\\n * \ud83d\uddfa [**Roadmaps**](/docs/category/roadmaps) - discover and complete #30Day journeys\\n * \ud83d\udcd6 [**Curricula**](/docs/category/curricula) - explore open-source multi-week courses with lesson plans\\n * \ud83c\udfaf [**Challenges**](/docs/category/challenges) - join challenges and compete with your peers\\n * \ud83d\udcac [**Discussions**](https://github.com/microsoft/30daysof/discussions) - ask questions, interact with peers, show-and-tell!\\n\\n## Your First Learning Actions\\n\\nWhere should you start? \\n\\n1. \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffd - [**Take a minute to introduce yourself**](https://github.com/microsoft/30daysof/discussions/3)  What are you looking to learn? What are *you* an expert in? Which region are you joining us from?\\n2. \ud83d\uddd3 - [**Check the calendar**](/calendar) - look for upcoming or in-progress learning journeys (e.g., #30Days) and join in! Work at your own pace, or look for events and discussions where you can interact with other learners.\\n3. \u23f0 - [**Cultivate learning habits**](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/04/education/edlife/learning-how-to-learn-barbara-oakley.html) - Use techniques that help you learn to learn better. Take breaks, switch between focused and relaxed modes, practice what you learn, and understand that each person learns differently.\\n4. \ud83c\udfaf - **Set a goal** - And keep moving towards it one step at a time. Connect with others in your community to get help, or feel inspired. Then pay it forward - more on that in the next section.\\n\\n\\n## Your First Learning Contributions\\n\\nDid you know that **writing things down** can help reinforce what you learned, and help you review or recall it much later? And that **sharing notes and insights** with others is not only a good way to contribute back to the community, but also help your career by building an online profile? As part of your learning journey, consider 3 ways in which you can contribute to others learning journeys (and your own):\\n\\n * [**Use our Discussion Boards**](https://github.com/microsoft/30daysof/discussions) - share notes, ask questions, or answer them.\\n * [**Share your Articles**](https://github.com/microsoft/30daysof/issues/new/choose) - use the _\ud83d\udc1d Community Buzz_ template to submit links to us.\\n * **Build Open Source Projects** - then write about it, and _Share your Articles_.\\n\\n\\n:::success READY?

However, the **Business Manager**, building the low code solutions lacks the coding background to use the API endpoints directly from his solution.\\nThe **Pro-Dev** therefore steps up to fill in the gap by building a connector to wrap the API and publishes it to the organization\'s environment. The **Business Manager** then uses this connector to access the external service, helping the team hit their business goals and everyone is happy.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What we covered today \\n[![YouTube](../fusion/img/icons8-youtube.svg \\"Watch the recording on YouTube\\")](https://youtu.be/E1KRpMrG9Wo)\\n\\nEvery person\'s role on the Power platform towards digital transformation.\\n![Power Platform for Everyone](../fusion/img/power-platform.png)\\n\\nWhat is a connector? **Note: Connectors allow you to not only access Microsoft products, but also external services**\\n![Connector definition](../fusion/img/connector-def.png)\\n\\nCustom connectors are used to:\\n\\n- Add services not currently supported\\n- Expand an exisiting connector that doesn\'t have the trigger/action you want to use\\n\\n### Step-by-step - Build a connector\\n**Step 1:** \ud83d\udcd6 Read the Docs/ know the API you want to build a connector for.\\n\\n**Step 2:** Start in one of the products (Power Apps, Power Automate or Logic Apps).

But before that, here is what you have done so far _(You can catch up with the others if you are a step behind ...)_\\n\\n1. Read the [previous summary blog](https://microsoft.github.io/30daysof/blog/fusion-build-a-connector/?WT.mc_id=academic-73999-juliamuiruri)\\n1.

Signed in to https://make.powerautomate.com/ or https://make.powerapps.com/ and attempted your first connector. [See how to start on the SWAPI connector here](https://youtu.be/CMCuNYVW4B0)\\n1. Talked to us on our [Discussion Forum](https://github.com/microsoft/30daysof/discussions/16) \ud83d\ude07\\n\\n## Day 5: Summary\\n[![YouTube](../fusion/img/icons8-youtube.svg \\"Watch the recording on YouTube\\")](https://youtu.be/li84cF9Zsrs)\\n\\nToday, we have covered building the SWAPI connector from scratch with an introduction to Triggers and Policies, consuming it directly from a Power App and learnt how to build a custom connector from an OpenAPI specification file.\\n\\nSuppose you want to build your first connector, what are your options?\\n1. _[Recommended]_ We have hundreds of existing services/ APIs that are inaccessible from the power platform today. You may decide to look through the [list of existing connectors](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/connector-reference/?WT.mc_id=academic-73999-juliamuiruri), identify a service with a Public API that is missing a connector and decide to build it for this hackathon. For inspiration on which connector you can build, see a list of the [Top Connector Asks Today](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPlatformConnectors/wiki/Top-Connector-Asks?WT.mc_id=academic-73999-juliamuiruri)\\n\\n    #### Steps\\n    A) Identify the Public API, describing available endpoints (/users), operations (GET/users) and operation parameters inputs & outputs\\n\\n    B) Obtain the OpenAPI spec file or Postman collection. APIs like the [Daraja API](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/APIs) have the Postman collections ready for you.\\n    ![Daraja API Postman collections](../fusion/img/daraja-api-postman.png)\\n\\n    C) Use it to create a connector\\n1. Create your own API, publish it, then create a connector for it.\\n\\n    #### Steps\\n    A) Write your own API\\n\\n    b) Generate an OpenAPI Spec file. (The  connector creation wizard currently supports only v2.0 spec files) \\n    \\n    - If you are working in python, you can use the [FastAPI framework](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/?WT.mc_id=academic-73999-juliamuiruri) which will document the API for you\\n\\n    - If JavaScript, you can use [Nestjs Framework](https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/introduction) for your API definition\\n    ![Nestjs - JavaScript](../fusion/img/nestjs.png)\\n\\n### What next after creating a connector?\\n![Steps to consume a connector](../fusion/img/consume-connector.png)\\n\\n### Actions, Triggers & Policy Templates\\nAn **Action** is what your connector can do. For example, the SWAPI Connector that we created today has an action called \'GetPeople\' that returns Star Wars characters and properties like: height, mass, hair color etc. from the API \\n\\nA **Trigger** is an event/ a condition that when met, causes the system to do something or respond to changes in the underlying data/service. For example, using the [Outlook.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/outlook/?WT.mc_id=academic-73999-juliamuiruri) connector, you can define steps to be takes automatically when a new email arrives in your inbox, and in this case, the **when a new email arrives** is a trigger for the outlook.com connector \\n\\nThere are 2 Types of Triggers:\\n![Trigger types](../fusion/img/types-of-triggers.png)\\n\\nA **Policy** is added while creating a connector to modify its behaviour at runtime. For example, if the API you are working with has a limited number of API calls, you can set throttling limits using a Policy\\n![An example of a policy](../fusion/img/policy-example.png)\\n\\n### Next Steps\\n- Head over to https://make.powerautomate.com/ and start today!\\n\\n- Explore resources shared on the [presentation deck](https://github.com/microsoft/30daysof/discussions/16#discussioncomment-3678667)\\n\\n- Build your first connector, share on Social media and tag us to celebrate your learning!\\n\\n:::success READY?

Here are some tips for you!\\n1. Always have a motive for building a connector. In this case, Shreyan found a way to not only help himself, but to also help others who might face similar problems. _Solving a problem for many in a creative way_\ud83d\ude03\\n1. You are **likely to encounter errors** while building your connector. Don\'t let this dishearten you - everyone faces them. Instead, when you get an error while testing your connector,\\n    - Visit the Response Body to read more on the error\\n    ![Debugging on power platform](../fusion/img/error-details.png)\\n    - Search the error online and there is a 95% chance that someone faced it before and posted the solution. See [discussions from other connector creators](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPlatformConnectors/discussions?WT.mc_id=academic-73999-juliamuiruri)\\n1. Debugging becomes a lot easier on Postman as compared to doing it on power platform. Once everything works on Postman, it can take you as little as 5 minutes to create the connector\\n1. If you don\'t understand the API you want to build a connector for, it becomes extremely difficult to build it successfully. For example, if your API requires Authentication, be extra keen on where the authorization takes place. Is it added to the header, body, query params ...?\\n\\n\\n### Next Steps\\n- Head over to https://make.powerautomate.com/ and start today!\\n\\n- Hear more from Shreyan himself on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/fShDeY7jmog)\\n\\n- Build your first connector, share on Social media and tag us to celebrate your learning!\\n\\n:::success READY?

Treat your connector as code and version control because its possible to make mistakes when doing everything on the UI \\n\\n1. With the CLI, you can have different versions of your connector on your local PC and it becomes easier to upgrade your connector.\\n\\n1. When a full schema is not required for the connector, use smaller schemas\\n\\n1. Always ensure you write a good descfeription for your connector\\n\\n1. Avoid a large connector. In the case where you are working with a bulky API, split the connectors in API groups, but then still be cautious not to have too many splits\\n\\n1. Use version in the API path. Example:\\n\\n        \\"paths\\": {\\n          \\"v1.0/groups/office365\\": {\\n            \\"post\\": ...\\n          }\\n        }\\n\\n1. Understand connector limits.

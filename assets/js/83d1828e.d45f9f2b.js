However, the **Business Manager**, building the low code solutions lacks the coding background to use the API endpoints directly from his solution.\\nThe **Pro-Dev** therefore steps up to fill in the gap by building a connector to wrap the API and publishes it to the organization\'s environment. The **Business Manager** then uses this connector to access the external service, helping the team hit their business goals and everyone is happy.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What we covered today \\n[![YouTube](../fusion/img/icons8-youtube.svg \\"Watch the recording on YouTube\\")](https://youtu.be/E1KRpMrG9Wo)\\n\\nEvery person\'s role on the Power platform towards digital transformation.\\n![Power Platform for Everyone](../fusion/img/power-platform.png)\\n\\nWhat is a connector? **Note: Connectors allow you to not only access Microsoft products, but also external services**\\n![Connector definition](../fusion/img/connector-def.png)\\n\\nCustom connectors are used to:\\n\\n- Add services not currently supported\\n- Expand an exisiting connector that doesn\'t have the trigger/action you want to use\\n\\n### Step-by-step - Build a connector\\n**Step 1:** \ud83d\udcd6 Read the Docs/ know the API you want to build a connector for.\\n\\n**Step 2:** Start in one of the products (Power Apps, Power Automate or Logic Apps).

For inspiration on which connector you can build, see a list of the [Top Connector Asks Today](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPlatformConnectors/wiki/Top-Connector-Asks?WT.mc_id=academic-73999-juliamuiruri)\\n\\n    #### Steps\\n    A) Identify the Public API, describing available endpoints (/users), operations (GET/users) and operation parameters inputs & outputs\\n\\n    B) Obtain the OpenAPI spec file or Postman collection. APIs like the [Daraja API](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/APIs) have the Postman collections ready for you.\\n    ![Daraja API Postman collections](../fusion/img/daraja-api-postman.png)\\n\\n    C) Use it to create a connector\\n1. Create your own API, publish it, then create a connector for it.\\n\\n    #### Steps\\n    A) Write your own API\\n\\n    b) Generate an OpenAPI Spec file. (The  connector creation wizard currently supports only v2.0 spec files) \\n    \\n    - If you are working in python, you can use the [FastAPI framework](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/?WT.mc_id=academic-73999-juliamuiruri) which will document the API for you\\n\\n    - If JavaScript, you can use [Nestjs Framework](https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/introduction) for your API definition\\n    ![Nestjs - JavaScript](../fusion/img/nestjs.png)\\n\\n### What next after creating a connector?\\n![Steps to consume a connector](../fusion/img/consume-connector.png)\\n\\n### Actions, Triggers & Policy Templates\\nAn **Action** is what your connector can do. For example, the SWAPI Connector that we created today has an action called \'GetPeople\' that returns Star Wars characters and properties like: height, mass, hair color etc. from the API \\n\\nA **Trigger** is an event/ a condition that when met, causes the system to do something or respond to changes in the underlying data/service. For example, using the [Outlook.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/outlook/?WT.mc_id=academic-73999-juliamuiruri) connector, you can define steps to be takes automatically when a new email arrives in your inbox, and in this case, the **when a new email arrives** is a trigger for the outlook.com connector \\n\\nThere are 2 Types of Triggers:\\n![Trigger types](../fusion/img/types-of-triggers.png)\\n\\nA **Policy** is added while creating a connector to modify its behaviour at runtime. For example, if the API you are working with has a limited number of API calls, you can set throttling limits using a Policy\\n![An example of a policy](../fusion/img/policy-example.png)\\n\\n### Next Steps\\nHead over to https://make.powerautomate.com/ and start today!\\n\\nExplore resources shared on the [presentation deck](https://github.com/microsoft/30daysof/discussions/16#discussioncomment-3678667)\\n\\nBuild your first connector, share on Social media and tag us to celebrate your learning!\\n\\n:::success READY?

(About)\\n * How can you _participate_? (Your First Actions)\\n * How can you _contribute_? (Share Insights)\\n * Who is behind this? (Team Contributors)\\n * **Join**: [\ud83d\udd0c The Connector Cloud Skills Challenge](https://aka.ms/ConnectorSkillsChallenge)\\n * **Join**: [\u26a1\ufe0f The Serverless Cloud Skills Challenge](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/challenges?id=b950cd7a-d456-46ab-81ba-3bd1ad86dc1c&WT.mc_id=javascript-74010-ninarasi)!\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n## Welcome! \\n\\nHello and welcome to the launch of the #30DaysOf learning hub. \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffd\\n\\nThis is a collaborative effort within Developer Relations to collect and share various resources that support self-study and structured learning for beginners and experienced devs alike. Technology changes fast! The only way to adapt, and thrive, is to learn continuously - and apply learnings to practical problems.\\n\\nSo, what does that learning journey look like? Think of it as four stages:\\n * **Welcome** - the onboarding phase, to set you up for success! \\n * **Guide** - the exploration phase, where you pick the learning path to follow.\\n * **Connect** - the community phase, where you meet & help others on that path.\\n * **Share** - the pay-it-forward phase, where you share insights for future travelers.\\n\\n![Placeholder banner with red flowers](./../../static/img/banners/empty.png)\\n\\n## About The Site\\n\\nLet\'s take a quick tour of this site and the various features it offers:\\n\\n * \ud83c\udfe0 [**Landing Page**](/) - explore the learning options available.\\n * \u270d\ud83c\udffc [**Blog**](/blog) - subscribe to the [feed](/blog/rss.xml) for announcements & updates\\n * \ud83d\uddd3 [**Calendar**](/calendar) - discover upcoming events, revisit archived ones\\n * \ud83d\uddfa [**Roadmaps**](/docs/category/roadmaps) - discover and complete #30Day journeys\\n * \ud83d\udcd6 [**Curricula**](/docs/category/curricula) - explore open-source multi-week courses with lesson plans\\n * \ud83c\udfaf [**Challenges**](/docs/category/challenges) - join challenges and compete with your peers\\n * \ud83d\udcac [**Discussions**](https://github.com/microsoft/30daysof/discussions) - ask questions, interact with peers, show-and-tell!\\n\\n## Your First Learning Actions\\n\\nWhere should you start? \\n\\n1. \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffd - [**Take a minute to introduce yourself**](https://github.com/microsoft/30daysof/discussions/3)  What are you looking to learn? What are *you* an expert in? Which region are you joining us from?\\n2. \ud83d\uddd3 - [**Check the calendar**](/calendar) - look for upcoming or in-progress learning journeys (e.g., #30Days) and join in! Work at your own pace, or look for events and discussions where you can interact with other learners.\\n3. \u23f0 - [**Cultivate learning habits**](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/04/education/edlife/learning-how-to-learn-barbara-oakley.html) - Use techniques that help you learn to learn better. Take breaks, switch between focused and relaxed modes, practice what you learn, and understand that each person learns differently.\\n4. \ud83c\udfaf - **Set a goal** - And keep moving towards it one step at a time. Connect with others in your community to get help, or feel inspired. Then pay it forward - more on that in the next section.\\n\\n\\n## Your First Learning Contributions\\n\\nDid you know that **writing things down** can help reinforce what you learned, and help you review or recall it much later? And that **sharing notes and insights** with others is not only a good way to contribute back to the community, but also help your career by building an online profile? As part of your learning journey, consider 3 ways in which you can contribute to others learning journeys (and your own):\\n\\n * [**Use our Discussion Boards**](https://github.com/microsoft/30daysof/discussions) - share notes, ask questions, or answer them.\\n * [**Share your Articles**](https://github.com/microsoft/30daysof/issues/new/choose) - use the _\ud83d\udc1d Community Buzz_ template to submit links to us.\\n * **Build Open Source Projects** - then write about it, and _Share your Articles_.\\n\\n\\n:::success READY? LET\'S GO! \ud83c\udf89\\nWe can\'t wait to see what you learn - next!\\n:::"}]}')}}]);
